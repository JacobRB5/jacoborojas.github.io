                Copyright infringement
            </h2>

            <h3>   
                Do you remember when A LOT of youtubers started complaining about how their videos where getting blocked or demonetized because of copyright infirngement, while they alleged "fair use"? Well, here we enter into one of the
                most common internet problems when creating content; copyright infringement. In summary, when you create a piece of creative content, such as art or illustrations or music, you legally own the rights to use that piece of art as you wiil.
                This makes it so that if someone puts some David Guetta music over their tutorial video, the author of said peace can ask for your music to be removed and/or ask for part of the revenues. The topic is complicated as you can allege for plagiarism but also
                getting "creatively insipired" is a valid reason to ommit copyright, as it is a common creative activity.

            <h2> Suplantation </h2>
            <h3>
              Suplantation is another problem that commonly arrises when using the internet. Why? Because to be a user of the internet you only need to create an e-mail adress, and said e-mail adress isn't verified in any sense, and most people also use to have more than one email. 
              Anyone can createa an account for anyting. From a child trying to acces adult content to an adult trying to get to know children. These, of course, are some of the worst case scenarios, but they are really common. Keep in mind that supplantation is illegal, though the facility 
              of doing so in the internet makes it seem not so illegal. Authorities, and parents, are in the duty to keep an eye and protect minors from possible risks.

                CyberBullying
            </h2>
            <h3> 
               You wouldn't believe how much time and effort, and as so emotional charge, children may put into video games. For me, it's truly sad to loose a specific Minecraft world for example. When children get involved in games, like online games, and there are children who find it fun to bully,
               CyberBullying becomes a common phenomena. Children making other children feel bad in their internet for the way they play "their lack of skins" or just normal bullying as in "your mom adopted you". With children getting involved in online games from very young, this makes for a common and sad problem.
               Parents, again, should be specially weary of these kind of situations and take care of their children.

                Cyber-Harrassment is a way of harrasment in which an attacker may threat a victim, for example by the sharing of private photos, with the objective to get some kind of advantage over the victim, like money or such photos.
